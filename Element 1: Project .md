We crave information, we crave interaction with others, we crave collision with souls, we crave connection with others.
This project shows the interaction of the individual with the information or conscious body around him. The 3d system built by Connection visually experiences this process. I transform the relationship between people and other people (information or conscious bodies) from concept to 3d effect more intuitively. It simulates the connection between human (consciousness) and the outside world. We shuttle between the virtual world and the real world every day, receiving various types of information, meeting countless souls and acquiring various kinds of information

## cuboid 
The polychromatic cuboid represents the information we receive every day and the conscious body of the soul. It is a library of information that we may come into contact with, gather information from it and yearn for soul bumps and sparks of thought. It's abstract but familiar, and it can change our thinking more or less. 
discolouration 
The information is varied and can change colour as it moves with the camera, just as the random and changeable things we experience every day 
## sphere 
The sphere in the middle can represent itself or the individual virtual consciousness, the metasomes. We may inadvertently or intentionally collide with our consciousness by craving more information.
## BGM
The background sound of a heartbeat is a proof that we exist.
## background 
Our big big world 

## code 
Music and frequency are added 
Several geometric shapes were created and their properties, including length, width, height, etc. 
Create a position relationship between the sphere and the cuboid. 
Added a background image. 
Maps were created for each object to represent its different attributes and meanings. 
Create mouse control camera Angle and position 
Create the lens path function.
Rotate into the model. Defines camera position and coordinate position.

In this semester of study, I am most interested in the 2d and music parts. They are really interesting, and the results are really beautiful and full of interaction. In the process of this project, I found that there are many functions that I want to do but I couldnâ€™t, which aroused my interest in JS. After observing and referencing a large amount of code, I found that I couldn't understand the logic of the author's code very well, so I wrote this project with difficulty, tried to combine multiple effects. Overall, what I like most is the colour-changing textures and soundtracks of the cuboid. They are effective and enhance the overall atmosphere. I hope that in the future code learning process, more observations of the logical relationship between each line of code, not just simply modify the parameters. Try to make my coding skills better and better.
